BouncyCastle PGP 
==========

*Static utility methods to get you to bouncing around in the [castle](http://www.bouncycastle.org) without spilling
your [PGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) cocktail*

To quote [John Opincar](http://jopinblog.wordpress.com/2008/06/23/pgp-single-pass-sign-and-encrypt-with-bouncy-castle/)

>> "...the off-the-shelf PGP functionality is severely lacking in real-world-usabaility..."

## WARNING

While I, personally (which is to say; no guarantees), am confident that the BouncyCastle crew know what they're dowing,
I don't (even less guarantees). This is ~~sparta~~ cryptography and you should verify that it does what you think it
does in the way it's supposed to be doing it.

### Howto

Read the unit test source for examples.

### Origin

This code is extracted, reworked, stuff done while at [iZettle](https://izettle.com), open sourcing is courtesy of them,
thanks!
